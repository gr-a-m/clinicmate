# ClinicMate

ClinicMate is a program for health clinics to manage their patients, nurses,
and doctors. It allows clinic workers to enter patient metrics, view those
metrics, analyzes those metrics with a number of statistical methods, and
comment on those metrics. It was made for a CSE 360 class project at ASU by
Grant Marshall, Amy Baldwin, Dan Howe, and Mark Karlsrud.
